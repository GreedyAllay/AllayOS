["A fun fighting game with blood. MAKE SURE TO HOLD ICON AND PRESS CHROME LOGO TO PLAY!!","An addictive little minigame with a box you need to tap and prevent from falling to the ground!","An emulator I made that represents how Windows 12 might look.","Huge thanks to JioAu for creating this game! Ported by Greedy Allay (me)","One of my very first best projects! This is the only version I could find but there exists a much more sophisticated version and even a V2!","Not working (yet), seems to crash even on a PC. Credits to bilman66 for making the initial Project."]
