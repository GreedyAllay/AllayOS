# Welcome to AllayOS!

Welcome to my Android remake!


# Modification of code

Good news! This project is completely open source, and created in a fork of scratch,  [Penguinmod](https://penguinmod.com), where you program using blocks instead of actual code.

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/GreedyAllay/AllayOS/tree/main/sourcecode), along with all the older versions.

## Using a custom repository to install custom applications

You need to head [here](https://github.com/GreedyAllay/AllayOS), and clone the repository. After that, head to the **catalog** folder, and start modifying the files. Make sure to enter your own repository name and your username into AllayOS, and restarting the app should show the files.
